##Description:
The Springwater Stack is a solid stack for small Meteor projects that target single page applications. It uses Cucumber instead of Velocity, for reasons to have a less steep learning curve for developers already familiar with Cucumber. This is also the choice for CoffeeScript and Stylus: minimal semi-colon use and more natural syntax of programming code for optimal collaboration. The Flow Router is chosen because its more efficient use with resources and having the focus on UI instead of being a full-feature router.
